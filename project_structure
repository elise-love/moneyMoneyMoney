'''
manage.py: 
This is Django¡¦s command-line utility script. 
It allows you to interact with the Django project, such as running the server (runserver), 
applying database migrations (migrate), creating new apps (startapp), and more.

requirements.txt: Lists all dependencies or Python packages the project needs. 
These packages can be installed using pip install -r requirements.txt. 
It usually includes packages like Django, Django REST Framework, and other libraries for handling data or authentication.

README.md: Provides project documentation. 
It often includes an overview, setup instructions, usage, and any specific notes for developers or users. 
This is usually the first file someone reads when exploring the project.

##
config/: This directory houses core configuration files for the Django project.

settings.py: Holds all configuration settings for the Django project, 
such as database connections, installed apps, middleware, and static files settings.

urls.py: Maps URLs to the views they should trigger. 
It defines the main URL routes, like /home or /api/, directing requests to the corresponding views or applications.

wsgi.py: Stands for Web Server Gateway Interface. 
It¡¦s a standard interface between web servers and Python web applications.
wsgi.py helps deploy Django apps on servers like Gunicorn or uWSGI.

##
money_manager/: This is the core Django app, where most of the business logic lives.

__init__.py: Marks this directory as a Python package.

models.py: Defines the database structure through Django¡¦s ORM (Object Relational Mapping). 
For a money management app, it could include models like User, Transaction, Account, etc.

views.py: Contains the main logic for handling requests and returning responses.
Each view corresponds to a specific function of the app, like viewing a balance or adding a transaction.

urls.py: Contains URL patterns specific to this app. 
These URLs are included in the project¡¦s main urls.py file to define routes specific to money management features.

serializers.py: Used with Django REST Framework (DRF) to convert Django models into JSON,
making data exchange easier between frontend and backend. Each model might have an associated serializer.

admin.py: Configures how models appear in the Django admin interface. 
You can register models and customize their display here, 
allowing for admin management of data (e.g., viewing users or transactions).

tasks.py: Optional file to manage background tasks, 
like sending reminders for payments or notifications. This often uses Celery or Django¡¦s background_task library.
'''

'''
api/: This folder is specific to the REST API,
which allows frontend applications to communicate with the backend.

__init__.py: Marks this directory as a Python package.

views.py: Handles API requests. 
Each API endpoint (like POST /api/transaction) is a view function or class method that processes data from the frontend.

urls.py: Manages URL routes for the API, making sure requests to /api/ go to the right views.

permissions.py: Defines access controls to restrict who can access specific endpoints. 
For example, only authenticated users might be allowed to add a new transaction.
'''

'''
frontend/: Directory for the frontend code, if using a JavaScript framework like React or Vue.

public/: Holds static assets like HTML files, favicon icons, or manifest files for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).

src/: Contains all core JavaScript code.

App.js: Entry point for the frontend application, rendering the main component and defining the primary app structure.

components/: Stores reusable UI components, like forms for adding transactions or tables for viewing balances.

services/: Defines functions that communicate with the API, such as addTransaction() or getBalance().

styles/: CSS or SCSS files to style the frontend components.
'''

'''
templates/: 
Houses HTML templates for Django to render dynamic content.

index.html: The main HTML file, possibly loading the JavaScript bundle from React or Vue, 
or rendering initial data from Django.
'''

'''
static/: Directory for static files used by the application.

css/: Custom CSS files for styling Django templates.

js/: Custom JavaScript files.

images/: Image assets used in the app.
'''

'''
scripts/: Contains utility scripts for setup, testing, or maintaining the application.

populate_db.py: A script for adding test data to the database,
which helps developers or testers work with pre-populated data.

backup_db.py: Automates the backup process of the database, helpful in production to secure data.
'''

'''
tests/: Contains all test files for the application, organized by functionality.

__init__.py: Marks this directory as a Python package.

test_models.py: Tests for database models, ensuring fields and constraints work as expected.

test_views.py: Tests for views in views.py, verifying that pages return correct data.

test_api.py: API-specific tests to confirm the API endpoints work as expected.

test_integration.py: Integration tests that cover multiple components working together, such as a user adding a transaction and verifying its display.
